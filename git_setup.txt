Live Exercises

The Lead Instructor and all the students remain in the virtual 
classroom as they tackle the exercises. When students need help, 
they can send a chat message to the Lead Instructor and the 
Lead Instructor jumps into a one-on-one video conference to 
privately answer student questions. At this time, students can share 
their own screen with the Lead instructor, and can even grant access 
to the Lead Instructor to remotely type into the studentâ€™s computer. 
This means students can ask instructors or each other for help and 
get the immediate feedback that is critical to learning.
